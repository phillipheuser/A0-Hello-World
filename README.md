A0 assignment Linux Programming, "Hello world"

My name is Phillip Heuser, I am a freshman at Judson University currently studying Computer Science to try and get a 4 year degree in the field. 

I am bowling for the Judson team. I have been bolwing almost my entire life.

I'm hoping to get a job in cyber securiety or software programming in the future. I'm dedicated to making my dream a reality.
